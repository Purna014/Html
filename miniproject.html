    <h3>AYN RAND</h3>
    <p>Alice O'Connor (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum;[c] February 2 [O.S. January 20], 1905  March 6, 1982), better
        known by her pen name Ayn Rand , was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher.[3] She is known
        for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system which she named Objectivism. Born and educated in
        Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two
        Broadway plays, Rand achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-selling
        work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her
        philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.</p>
